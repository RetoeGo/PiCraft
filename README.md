PiCraft is a tool that generates Minecraft structures by converting text into an image, image into an object, and the object into a Minecraft nbt file.
The nbt files are placed in a datapack, therefore the dapack can be easily imported into Minecraft. 
The figure below shows the pipeline of the tool.
